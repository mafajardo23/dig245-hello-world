<h2>Some facts about me...</h2>

<h4>
<ul>
    <li>I am a freshman</li>
    <li>My intended major is Computer Science</li>
    <li>My intended minor is Digital Studies</li>
  </ul> 
</h4>

<h2>Why I am taking this course:</h2>
<p>I recently started to work with the Hack@Davidson Hackathon for the marketing department updating their website so all of this information is useful. Additionally, I have always had a passion for design.</p>

<h2>What experience do you have creating content for the web or programming?</h2>
<p>I took a Cryptography course junior year and I learned some python. Then I took a java class and learned the basics. Now I just started with the Hackathon team learning a little about Git and these different libraries but I am definitely a beginner.</p>

<h2>What are your goals in this course?</h2>
<p>My goals for this course are to be confident in creating even a simple web page. To understand Web Design a little more and to think critically about the experience of the user.</p>
